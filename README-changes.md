MYSTERY WORD README :

First repository :

I’m new on github, yet the only program i’ve made is this one so i’m just jumping in and trying to understand.

If u guys have any idea how to help me, i’m pretty new into programming and allowing anyone to teach whatever he feels could be useful :) ( even if it’s just the way github works ). I’ll take everything !

So I'm actually into C++ for now, i've started C then gave up cause i was too young i guess. Now i'm back into programming and liking the C++ :). I've heard reading projects is keystone in programming. So I guess that's the main reason i'm here !
